# 🧰 Ansible Configuration Management Lab Portfolio

Welcome! This GitHub repository is a curated collection of real-world Ansible labs focused on infrastructure automation, configuration management, and IT asset tracking — tailored for operational and compliance-focused environments.

### 📌 Why I Built This

As a Technology Solutions Architect working in a regulated utility environment, I’ve been hands-on with SolarWinds, NIST-aligned baselining, and asset inventories. I created this GitHub portfolio as a professional workspace to:

- Document practical, job-aligned labs
- Share proof of automation experience
- Track progression as I expand my config management expertise

Rather than uploading outdated or incomplete projects, I’ve chosen to build a **purposeful, up-to-date showcase** of tools I actively use — like Ansible.
